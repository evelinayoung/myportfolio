            <h2>Evelina Young</h2>
            <p>
                A whole section about me? I don’t have enough space to write my life's journey and 
                I’m sure you don’t have time to dive deep into my personal life.But, 
                I will say entering in this new life’s era has made me challenge myself and my skills. 
                Previously, I was giving my creative energy away to things like hairstyling, 
                makeup and fashion. However, I always desired something bigger than myself.My aha moment came when 
                I was In the middle of helping a friend scale their fashion line 
                I was able to see clearly my true purpose and passion: 
                I love to see others succeed. 
                I enjoy creating great platforms for others to maximize their full potential in business and personal 
                lives. I am an individual who enjoys taking risk and my most admirable quality is being open-minded. I mean, how can you grow or succeed if you don’t have room to receive. I am fully committed to mastering my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in order to create, design and encourage those who need to add flare and spunk to reach their goals. The root of my happiness comes from being of service to others no matter what code block 
                I come upon I will always find a way to solve it… Thank You Google.
